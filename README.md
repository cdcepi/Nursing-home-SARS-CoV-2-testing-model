This is a page for hosting code used to model testing strategies to control outbreaks of COVID-19 in nursing homes.  
The two types of testing strategies modeled were "outbreak testing" and "non-outbreak testing."
Outbreak testing: serial testing of all nursing home healthcare personnel and residents upon initial identification of a COVID-19 case
Non-outbreak testing: serial testing of all nursing home healthcare personnel when no COVID-19 cases are known
